                    gesture of yours. We in Uttar Pradesh are all proud of Sheilas work as well as your work personally
                    and through IASDS. It will be a privilege to be present in the occasion. With kind regards.

                    There is something very special about you and it becomes almost impossible for anyone not to be
                    influenced by it. I am sorry that I could not be there from the beginning but it was very important
                    for me to listen to the proceedings. Values are fast fading and I was able to see it in you and
                    thats enough for me to have liked every bit of the day. Congratulations!!! I will be away for 10
                    days but I will give you a call once I am back.
